It makes our environment unhealthy .Any waste material like cans, bottles, paper, kitchen waste and plastic bags are called garbage. There are things which can be reused, but we throw them away.
First of all, as kids we can tell our parents, neighbors and classmates about reducing the amount of garbage they throw away. We can collect all the things which can be recycled, like cans, paper, plastic </p>
